"""
Channel join control, extended by other hooks.

Config:
    hooks ((str, str list) dict):
        Mapping of controlling hooks to a list of channels they manage.
    exclude ((str, str list) dict):
        Mapping of plugs to user IDs who should be ignored during checks.
    joins (bool):
        ``True`` to check each join as it happens.
    startup (bool):
        ``True`` to run a full check of all named channels on load.
    passive (bool):
        ``True`` to log violations without actually following through with removals.

This hook implements its own protocol for test purposes, by rejecting all joins and members of a
channel.  To make full use of it, other hooks with support for channel access can determine if a
user satisfies membership of an external group or application.
