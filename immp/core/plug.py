    """
    Base of all plug classes, handles communication with an external network by converting
    outside data into standardised message objects, and pushing new messages into the network.

    Instantiation may raise :class:`.ConfigError` if the provided configuration is invalid.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            User-provided, unique name of the plug, used for config references.
        config (dict):
            Reference to the user-provided configuration.
        host (.Host):
            Controlling host instance, providing access to plugs.
        virtual (bool):
            ``True`` if managed by another component (e.g. a hook that exposes plug functionality).
        network_name (str):
            Readable name of the underlying network, for use when displaying info about this plug.
        network_id (str):
            Unique and stable identifier for this plug.

            This should usually vary by the account or keys being used to connect, but persistent
            with later connections.  If a network provides multiple distinct spaces, this should
